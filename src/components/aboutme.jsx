                    I am a full stack developer with a passion for learning and creating new things. I have experience in web development,
                    mobile development, and data analysis. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
                    I am currently studying computer science at the University of Buenos Aires and working as a freelance developer.
                    I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and various frameworks and libraries such as React and Node.js. I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end development projects, and I strive to create user-friendly and visually appealing applications. In my free time, I like to contribute to open-source projects and expand my knowledge by exploring new technologies. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you would like to collaborate on a project. Thank you for visiting my portfolio website!
